# 30-days-of-code

I have made a promise to myself that I will be true to myself for the next 30 days and try coding and meanwhile move on to competitive coding.
If someone goes through this I hope you would encourage and help me rather than bring me down.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.

28-03-2021: Well not exactly the time frame I had in mind, I wasted a lot of time in getting adjusted to my new work environment.
Let's hope I keep this up.
Not a major accomplishment but, "Rome wasn't built in a day" I will get there eventually.

Next up Freecodecamp Js course and LINUX from Hackerrank.
